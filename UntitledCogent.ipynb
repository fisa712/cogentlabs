His parents were \\nvery hard- working and deeply religious people, but so poor \\nthat they lived with their five children in only two rooms. \\nThe father and mother spent their evenings in reading aloud \\nto their children, generally from books of a serious charac -\\nter.\\nThough always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out \\nthird in the final examination of the Petersburg school of \\nEngineering. There he had already begun his first work, \\nâ€˜Poor Folk.â€™\\nThis story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his \\nreview and was received with acclamations. The shy, un -\\nknown youth found himself instantly something of a \\ncelebrity. A brilliant and successful career seemed to open \\nbefore him, but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he \\nwas arrested.\\nThough neither by temperament nor conviction a revolu -\\ntionist, Dostoevsky was one of a little group of young men \\nwho met together to read Fourier and Proudhon. He was ac -\\ncused of â€˜taking part in conversations against the censorship, \\nof reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of knowing \\nof the intention to set up a printing press.â€™ Under Nicholas I.' metadata={'source': './books/crime-and-punishment.pdf', 'page': 1}\n"
